My quake 4 midterm project

This mod turns quake 4 into an endless mode where the weapons and powerups are swapped randomly between different pseudo gamemodes, 
based on the configuration of weapons and powerups.

To play: Load up the mod and type "map mp/q4xdm15" into the console, which can be oped with  ctrl + alt + ~

Direct player changes:
The player starts out with 500 health by default, as otherwise the player would die very quickly

Indirect or Powerup changes:
Quad damage has higher deathpush
Haste makes the player go even faster then before
ammo regen also increases speed, but not nearly as fast
health regen also slows the player
Invisibility works on the AI

Weapon Changes
Altered blaster to act as a minelayer (Shots stay in place and are always charged)
Rocket launcher, grenade laucnher and shotgun fire much slower
Dark mater gun acts as black hole placer, with larger radius and uped damage
Napalmgun has a longer range
Gauntllet deals a bit less damage and attack speed but as uped range 
Machinegun has silly looking model with high deathpush
Railgun deals way more damage to the point of always insta-killing
Nailgun deals more damge

Endless Mode quicks:
You have a minute to wander and explore before the wave starts. In this time, all the weapons (except the lighting gun) can be played with
Once it starts, the waves will come in 30sec intervals, and then its all a matter of survival

To restart, retype in the command for the map. Doing it via menu will exit the game
